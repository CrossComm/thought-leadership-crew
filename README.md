### Task Configuration

The crew executes tasks in a hybrid sequential-parallel pattern:

1. **News Collection Task** (`collect_and_enrich_news`)
   - Searches trusted sources for recent articles
   - Extracts titles, summaries, URLs, and metadata
   - Filters based on initial relevance criteria
   - Output: `news_collector_output.json`

2. **Analysis Task** (`analyze_and_select_stories`)  
   - Applies strategic frameworks to collected news
   - Scores each article on multiple dimensions
   - Ranks by strategic importance
   - Output: `analyze_and_select_stories_output.json`

3. **Parallel Processing** (async_execution=True):
   
   **3a. Digest Creation Task** (`create_executive_digest`)
   - Synthesizes top stories into briefing format
   - Verifies key facts and statistics
   - Adds strategic context and implications
   - Output: `executive_digest.md`
   
   **3b. Social Publishing Task** (`create_social_media_posts`)
   - Transforms analysis into social content
   - Optimizes for platform-specific formats
   - Maintains professional thought leadership tone
   - Output: `social_media_posts.md`

4. **Final Assembly Task** (`compile_final_deliverables`)
   - Waits for both async tasks to complete
   - Combines executive digest and social media posts
   - Creates unified deliverable document
   - Output: `final_deliverables.md`

### Execution Flow Benefits

The parallel execution of digest creation and social media post generation:
- **Enables specialized optimization** for each output format
- **Maintains consistency** through shared analysis data
- **Allows independent fact-checking** and verification

### Customization Points

You can customize the crew's behavior by modifying:

- **Agent Personalities** (`config/agents.yaml`): Adjust roles, goals, and backstories
- **Task Definitions** (`config/tasks.yaml`): Modify task descriptions and expected outputs
- **User Preferences** (`knowledge/user_preference.txt`): Define your specific context:
  ```
  Role: [Your role, e.g., "CTO of a FinTech startup"]
  Objective: [Your goal, e.g., "Stay ahead of AI and blockchain developments"]
  Trusted Sources: [Your preferred news sources]
  ```
